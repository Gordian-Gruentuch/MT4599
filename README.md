<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains all figures of the MT4599 thesis in interactive form, and includes even additional figures to complement the thesis (see Chapter 4).

### Jupyter

This directory features interactive Jupyter notebooks that are sorted by chapter. The figures were generated as part of Jupyter notebooks and then exported as images.
The Jupyter notebooks contains sections from the ’Design Principles of Genetic Circuits’ course by [Bois and Elowitz, 2019].

### Results

This directory features the generated results from the Jupyter notebooks in .png format. The results of Chapters 2-4 can be found in the subdirectory 'Images'.
The results of Chapters 5 can be found in the subdirectory 'Simulations'.

### Built With

The Jupyter notebooks were built using Python 3.7.3.

The key libraries for this project were:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Biocircuits](https://biocircuits.github.io/)
* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The notebooks require Python 3.7+.

The notebooks include packages that are not included in the default Anaconda distribution. These include bokeh, and biocircuits

In order to configure JupyterLab to work with Bokeh, one can use:

  ```sh
  jupyter labextension install --no-build jupyterlab_bokeh
  jupyter labextension install --no-build @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
   ```

Biocircuits can be installed using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install biocircuits
   ```
